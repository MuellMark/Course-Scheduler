## About
Course scheduling is laborious and subject to many fixed university requirements. However, there are enough changing factors to make it difficult to reuse schedules from prior years, making it cumbersome for department chairs. By documenting these course and faculty restrictions, a Python tool has already been created that takes in CSV files of said constraints and generates a linear program that runs through an existing tool for linear programming, PyGLPK, to schedule the courses. 

While this tool is already usable by some, it is unintuitive and requires some programming knowledge to run. The goal of this computer science capstone project is to create a user-friendly web-based version of the scheduler so that more departments can utilize it to schedule their courses. This site includes intuitive interfaces to create CSV files, run the software tool, and display the generated schedule.
